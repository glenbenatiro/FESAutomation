1.48
- issue fix: 0 is copied even though head electrode not read when electrode size is big
- issue fix: correct statistical frequency of finger bendings when electrode size is big (every big location counted as 1 value, not 4)
- added electrode size in HTML heatmap



1.47
- !CAUTION: please use program as is, no error traps in program yet
- added functionality: delete data from a specific location
- added functionality: add calculation for middle finger s. freq, posted in .csv file 
- added functionality: select electrode size. if size is big, copy flexBendingPercentage data to adjacent locations to suffice 2x2 size. also reflected in heatmap and csv (flexBendingPercentage alone for now!)
- turned off stimulation signals from AD2 when exiting data gathering session (not turned off in previous versions)
- changed 'N/A' in heatmap to '-' for unstimulated locations
- fixed wrong color (yellow or orange instead of shades of red) in HTML heatmap output
- changed color scheme: 0 to 100 is green, -1 to -100 is red, else is blue
- changed code for calculating and writing color in HTML file; shorter, cleaner, more precise code
- added code to retain 'results' folder, but doesn't include files inside 'results' during commit
- removed 'manuals' folder to lessen package size


1.46
- changed 'flexProbability' to 'flexBendingPercentage'
- changed 'flexBendingPercentage != NULL' to 'isElectrodeRead[c][r]' in writing results to HTML file
- added isElectrodeRead[c][r] = true in dataSeeder function
- removed saveToFile() function
- changed 'results/*' to 'results/' in .gitignore
- removed license declaration at main.cpp
- code reformatting and cleanup


1.43
- fixed reset program not working
- added an indication when electrode location has been finished reading
- added subject and electrode offset display in main menu
- changed navigator function, added return value modes (0: actual/absolute, 1: relative, starts at 0, 2: relative, starts at 1
- removed press any key to continue when AD2 is detected 
- changed matrix color to red (from green)
- magenta if value is above 100, gray if value is below 0
- last location used in UI navigation when going back (does not return to upper left location always)
- AD2 circuity swithces turned off after storing data in actual data gathering (not turned off in previous vesions)
- added actual array values display after selecting specific electrode
- more comments
- code reformatting, cleaner, shorter code

1.42
- changed code for more accurate vpot measurement

1.41
- added error message if probability is greater than 100 or lesser than 0, but value is still stored
